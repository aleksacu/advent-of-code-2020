Solutions to advent of code puzzles in various programming languages

Main solutions are mostly going to be written in go, but sometimes in other languages
as well. All the solutions are going to be rewritten in rust (`riir` directory).

At least some of the solutions are hopefully going to be streamed live on [aleksacu](https://twitch.tv/aleksacu)
